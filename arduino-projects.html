                      <h2>ðŸ§  Project Title: Color Detection Eraser</h2>
                      <p>ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Automatically erase a surface (like a whiteboard or paper) only when
                         a specific color is detected using a sensor. A solenoid moves the eraser, and 
                         magnets help with alignment or control.</p>
                     <p>The Arduino-based color detection eraser is an automated project designed to 
                        identify specific colors on a surfaceâ€”such as a whiteboard or paperâ€”and erase 
                        them selectively. At the heart of the project is a color sensor (like the TCS3200 or TCS34725),
                         which reads the color of the markings. The Arduino processes the sensor data and checks whether
                          the detected color matches a predefined target (for example, red ink). Once the target color is 
                          identified, the Arduino triggers a solenoid actuator, which physically pushes the eraser down onto
                           the surface. The solenoid acts like an electromagnetic plunger, providing the force needed to erase
                            the markings. To aid in the movement and positioning of the eraser, magnets are incorporated into
                            the system. These can be used to guide the eraser smoothly along a track or to interact with a Hall
                             effect sensor that helps the Arduino determine the position of the eraser. The magnetic setup ensures 
                             precision and can help return the eraser to a default or "home" position after each operation. This
                              project combines elements of color sensing, electromagnetism, and mechanical control, demonstrating
                               how Arduino can be used to build smart systems that respond to visual inputs. It can be expanded with
                                features like servos for lateral movement or LED indicators for feedback, making it an engaging project
                                 for learning automation and embedded systems.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ§  Project Title: SUMOROBOT</h2>
        <p>ðŸŽ¯ Goal: The goal of the Sumo Robot project is to design and build an autonomous robot 
            that can intelligently detect, engage, and push an opponent robot out of a circular 
            arena without exiting the ring itself. This involves implementing precise sensor-based
             navigation, strategic movement, and strong motor control to win matches, while also 
             developing the builderâ€™s skills in robotics, electronics, and programming.</p>
        <p>The Sumo Robot project is a robotics competition challenge where an autonomous robot is 
            designed to detect and push an opponent out of a circular ring while avoiding self-elimination.
             The project involves integrating sensors such as infrared or ultrasonic for opponent detection 
             and line sensors for edge detection, all controlled by a microcontroller like an Arduino. The main
              goal is to create a fast, stable, and intelligent robot that can make real-time decisions to 
              dominate matches through strategic movement and force. This project aims to enhance skills in
               electronics, programming, and robotics by applying them in a fun and competitive environment.</p>

         <h2>ðŸ§  Project Title: Fingerprint Attendance System with SMS Alert</h2>
         <p>ðŸŽ¯ Goal: The goal of this project is to automate attendance tracking using biometric
             verification while enhancing communication with parents by sending real-time SMS alerts. 
             It aims to reduce manual attendance errors, prevent proxy attendance, and improve student
              monitoring by notifying parents every time their child arrives at school.</p>
         <p>The Fingerprint Attendance System with SMS Alert is an Arduino-based biometric project 
            designed for educational institutions or small offices. The system uses a fingerprint sensor
             to record a studentâ€™s or employeeâ€™s attendance. When a registered fingerprint is scanned, the 
             system logs the attendance and immediately sends an SMS notification to the parent or guardianâ€™s 
             phone using a GSM module. This real-time communication keeps parents informed of their childâ€™s 
             presence at school and adds a layer of accountability and safety.</p>

             <h2>ðŸ§  Project Title: Autonomous Waste Segregation System</h2>
             <p>ðŸŽ¯ The main goal of this project is to automate waste segregation using sensor technology to
                 reduce human error, encourage recycling, and enhance waste management efficiency. By sorting 
                 paper, plastic, and metal waste autonomously, this system supports environmental sustainability
                  and prepares waste for appropriate recycling processes.</p>
             <p>The Autonomous Waste Segregation System is an Arduino-powered smart solution designed to 
                identify and automatically sort common types of solid wasteâ€”specifically paper, metal, and 
                plasticâ€”into separate bins. It uses a color sensor to detect paper waste, particularly white or 
                printed paper, a capacitive sensor to identify metallic waste like aluminum or tin, and an 
                inductive sensor to detect plastic items. The system uses this sensor data to automatically 
                divert the waste into appropriate bins using servo-controlled gates or a sorting arm, significantly 
                improving the speed and accuracy of waste handling in homes, schools, or waste collection centers.</p>

             <h2>ðŸ§  Project Title: Autonomous Cashier System</h2>
             <p>ðŸŽ¯ Goal: The goal of this project is to develop a fully autonomous, Arduino-compatible cashier system that 
                can accept, validate, and process cash payments (both coins and bills), return accurate change, and print 
                receipts, all without human input. This project aims to offer a practical, low-maintenance solution for small 
                businesses and public services seeking to automate payment and transaction handling efficiently and reliably.</p>
             <p>The Autonomous Cashier System is a self-service payment solution powered by ESP32, designed to handle physical cash
                 transactions without 
                human intervention. It incorporates a bill acceptor, coin acceptor, coin changer, and a Bluetooth thermal printer. 
                The system accepts coins and paper bills, verifies the total payment, dispenses the correct change, and prints a 
                transaction receiptâ€”all 
                managed through the ESP32 microcontroller. Ideal for vending machines, laundry kiosks, or ticketing stations, 
                this compact system streamlines
                 the payment process and reduces the need for staff supervision.

             <h2>ðŸ§  Project Title: Fire Detection Robot </h2>
             <p>ðŸŽ¯ Goal: The goal of this project is to develop an autonomous robot capable of detecting and responding to 
                fire hazards by identifying flames, approaching the danger zone, and activating a fire extinguisher using a
                 servo mechanism. It aims to provide a first-response fire suppression system that can work in confined or 
                 hard-to-reach areas, helping reduce damage before human intervention is possible.</p>
             <p>The Fire Detection Robot is an autonomous, mobile firefighting unit designed to detect fire and respond 
                quickly to suppress it. Built on a two-wheeled robot platform, the system uses flame sensors to detect the
                presence and direction of fire. Once detected, the robot navigates toward the source of the flame. Upon reaching
                 the fire, a servo motor activates a small portable fire extinguisher, releasing a burst to suppress the flame.
                  This robot is ideal for indoor fire monitoring in critical zones such as server rooms, kitchens, or small warehouses.</p>
